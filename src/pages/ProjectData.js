    // Add below details also.
//     Recotech implements Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) across all features and the dashboard, ensuring a highly secure and structured user experience. Each role—Super Admin, Admin, Operator, Reception, Storage, Parts, Sales—has granular access permissions.

// Some users have full control (create, update, delete), while others have limited permissions (view-only or add-only).
// The dashboard dynamically adapts based on the user’s role, restricting access to unauthorized sections.
// Features like Projects, Statements, Inventory, and Documents are all role-gated, ensuring users only see and modify what they are authorized to.
// This structured RBAC implementation enhances security, prevents unauthorized actions, and streamlines operations within Recotech.
